Given a two colour bitmap, determine the area of the largest square of 'on' pixels.

Your bitmap is given as text (string where 1 indicates colour 'on' and 0 'off') and width (int).

You can assume your input text length is a multiple of the width, and there is only 1 and 0 characters present.

Example:

text: "0111111111111111" width: 4

bitmap looks like:

	0111
	1111
	1111
	1111

the largest square is 3x3, so the area is 9
